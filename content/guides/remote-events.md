# Remote Events
A `RemoteEvent` fires one-way events between the server and clients. It doesn't wait for a response and has no return value. It's built for telling the other side what happened, not asking the other side for a result. For a call that needs a response, use [RemoteFunction](/guides/remote-functions/) instead.

The primary parent container for remote events is `ReplicatedStorage`, as both the server and client can see and access it.
> ⚠ **Security note:** never trust arguments a client sends via `FireServer` at
> face value - a modified client can call it with anything. Re-validate
> any arguments on the server before acting on it.

## Example
In this example, pressing `E` changes a part named `ColorBlock` to a random color. Key presses can only be detected on the client, but the color change needs to happen on the server so every player sees the same result, which is what the remote event is for.

## Server Script
- placed in `ServerScriptService`
- be sure to create an event named `ChangeColor` parented to `ReplicatedStorage`
```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local changeColor = ReplicatedStorage.ChangeColor
local colorBlock = workspace.ColorBlock

changeColor.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player)
    colorBlock.Color = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255))
end)
```

## Client Script
- placed in `StarterPlayerScripts`
```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

local changeColor = ReplicatedStorage.ChangeColor

UserInputService.InputBegan:Connect(function(input)
    if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.E then
        changeColor:FireServer()
    end
end)
```
